This is a physics engine experiment that lets you interact with objects using your mouse.

It uses Matter.js for:

Rigid body physics

Collision detection

Gravity

Constraints

Mouse interaction

It also uses:

Tailwind CSS

Font Awesome

What you can do:

Interact with objects using your mouse and drag them, throw them.

Play with gravity and elasticity settings to see how the physics respond.

Create as many objects as you can and try to push the engine to its limits.

Explore how the hover effects behave as you interact with different elements.

Spoiler:
We left a secret message hidden in the project as a small thank-you. See if you can find it
